Hello :)

Since I'm Sub20 (some weeks ago) I improved very fast! I got a 18.77 Ao100 yesterday.
I decided that my target is to get Sub15 to the end of this year. This would be pretty cool, but it's a high goal, so we will see.

I try to arrange something to do with my YouTube-Channel to produce videos according to this topic.
I find Cubologists Road to Sub 20 series pretty amusing and interesting, so maybe I'll do something similar.
