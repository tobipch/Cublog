Hello :)

Yesterday, I discovered something pretty ridiculous.
I was very tired when I came home after work. Nevertheless I catched my cube up and did some timed solves. After 12 solves I had an avg of 18.xx which is very good for me.
Then I started to focus. I actively tracked pairs, thought about faster ways to solve the cross etc. This eventually will be my best Ao100.
Next 12 solves ; I had a superbad 22.xx Ao12.

I was astonished that with no concentration or better said with no real focus, my solves went better. I tried to switch my focus on and off and my thesis seemed correct.

What do you think about it? Did you experience something similar to this? Tell me more in the comments!

Greetings from Switzerland
