Hello :)

Yesterday evening I made some really nice progress on the 3x3.

I improved my Single from 15.78s to 12.55s with a LL-Skip, so a really lucky one, but I take it

I later made an non-lucky 14.xx solve which is also very nice!

Further I improved my Ao100 nearly a second down from 22.00s to 21.22s.

My Ao5 went also down, but not that much. 18.89s to 18.58s. But I'm so happy that I'm improving, it feels so good!

I also set a Ao100 PB on the 2x2. I went from 6.90s to 6.34s. I constantly get nearer to the 5s mark.

Greetings from Switzerland
