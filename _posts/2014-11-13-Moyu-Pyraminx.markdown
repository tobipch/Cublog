Hello :)

The Moyu Pyraminx feels like heaven. This thing is the best Pyraminx I ever tried.
I ordered it from Lightake and after one and a half week, it finally arrived.
The waiting was worth it. I played around with it (PB Ao100 --> 5.46 BTW) and then I did a solve with my old Shengshou Pyraminx. God, it turned like stones.

I can just recommend this monster!
