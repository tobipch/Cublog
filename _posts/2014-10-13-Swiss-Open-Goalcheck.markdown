Hello :)

Here are the checks for my [Swiss Science Open Goals](http://tobipch.github.io/Cublog//general/swissscienceopen/tournament/competition/goals/2014/09/23/Swiss-Open-Goals.html).
I wrote each best avg (first row) and best single (second row) with the associated goals (in the brackets) into the following list:

**2x2** - 6.21 (\<6.00) - 4.27 (\<5.00)

**3x3** - 19.02 (\<21.00) - 15.98 (\<20.00)

**4x4** - 1:30.08 (\<1:30) - 1:14.25 (\<1:25.00)

**5x5** - 3:33.98 (\<4:20) - 3:32.50 (\<4:00.00)

**Pyra** - 5.39 (\<6.00) - 2.93 NR (\<5.00)

I'm very very happy about this times and with the overall results. I mean, NR at the second competition :) Couldn't be better!

Greetings from Switzerland
