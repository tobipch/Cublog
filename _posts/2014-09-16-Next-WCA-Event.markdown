Hello :)

At the moment, [this forum-post](http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?45359-What-puzzle-do-you-think-the-WCA-should-add-next) is very popular.
A lot of people write a lot of suggestions, here are mine. The next event the wca should add is at least one of these:

* **Collaboration 3x3 Solve** (Change cube after Cross / Each F2L pair / OLL and PLL)
* **2-4 Relay**
* **5 Multi 3x3** (Solve five 3x3's as fast as you can)

The interaction with other Cubers (as partner) or with other cubes (like relay or multi) is something I miss.
