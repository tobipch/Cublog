Hello :)

When I started cubing (in March '14) , my most prioritized target was to get a Sub20 Ao100.
I thought I have to put high goals and therefore I wanted to reach the goal till the end of the year.
I thought it would be nearly impossible.

But now I reached the goal... Finally! I stucked for a long time around 20 to 22.
Yesterday I made my first Ao100 under 20 Seconds (19.97s).

I'm really happy!
